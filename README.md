# CV

## Scott Gledhill

I am a junior web developer with a love for data, logic and problem solving! I was previously a successful professional online poker player for 8 years, I got to travel the world playing, and enjoy the thrills of competing for large amounts of money! I have strong interpersonal and communication skills, with an inclination for logical thinking patterns & strategic decision making. 

I studied web development at Makers Academy and fell in love with software programming, design and complex problem solving! I am looking for a role that will allow me to harness these skills while continuing to progress as a developer. I want to be part of a challenging and exciting work environment that seeks to genuinely influence peoples every day lives.

I currently coach potential Makers Academy candidates through the interview process and can be booked at [sharetribe](https://makersacademy.sharetribe.com/en/scottgledhill). I have completed over 100 hours of pairing this way, and have 100% positive feedback with over 50 reviews! I also coached at [RailsGirls](http://railsgirls.com/london) last year. 

## Skills

#### Analyst

Most FAQ: How do you know if someone is bluffing online, you can't see them!?<br>
As a professional online poker player, I spent hundreds of hours compiling data, running simulations and looking for exploitable patterns. <br>
I am fascinated by big data samples and used data analysis to take the most game theory optimal options! 

#### Self-led learner

I completed the 12-week full-time curriculum at the Makers Academy bootcamp in London, filled with intense, test-driven pair-programming and exposure to theory and best practice during the week, followed by individual 'real-world related' challenges every weekend. We were taught to be agile, value teamwork and learn new concepts quickly.

I completed every challenge, using Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, AngularJS, HTML, CSS and more, all test-driven.

I learned to love Git. I became very comfortable with using Git to manage different features during development. We used a technique we named 'Git-pong' which involved collaborating with multiple people across days of the week on different branches, I am now very comfortable working on unfamiliar code bases and have experience dealing with different branches, merging and making pull requests as necessary.

I enjoyed learning about concepts and technologies outside of the scope of the Makers curriculum, by attending meet-ups and workshops, and learning new technologies. I attended [Rails Camp](http://railscamp.eu/) in Scotland in 2016, subjecting myself to the Scottish weather, all for a little learning! And was lucky enough to attend Dublin Tech Summit in February of last year. 

#### Team player

As a Makers Academy graduate I have spent a lot of time not only pair programming but working in small teams, using small design sprints. My favourite period of the course was the final two weeks, where we produced the above linked app to a deadline. I find these kind of high pressure situations exciting and motivating. I have found that this is often where I do my best work, and am forced to learn and adapt quickly. I have also found that understanding the thought processes of others, as well as having to explain my own, has been an invaluable learning tool, and improved my communication skills.
